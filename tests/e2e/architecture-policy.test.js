/**
 * Architecture policy tests — automated detection for direct process
 * execution imports that bypass the foundation layer abstraction.
 *
 * The foundation layer (@n-dx/llm-client/exec.ts) provides exec(),
 * spawnTool(), and spawnManaged() so domain packages never need to
 * import from node:child_process directly.
 *
 * @see tests/e2e/domain-isolation.test.js — cross-package gateway enforcement
 * @see packages/web/tests/integration/boundary-check.test.ts — intra-package server/viewer boundary
 *
 * These three test files together enforce the full architectural guardrail suite.
 * Changes to one should be reviewed against the others for consistency.
 *
 * Allowed exceptions:
 *   1. @n-dx/llm-client/src/exec.ts — the abstraction itself
 *   2. @n-dx/llm-client/src/cli-provider.ts — Claude CLI streaming (needs raw spawn for event parsing)
 *   3. @n-dx/llm-client/src/codex-cli-provider.ts — Codex CLI streaming (same reason)
 *   4. packages/hench/src/agent/lifecycle/cli-loop.ts — Claude CLI streaming (same reason)
 *   5. Orchestration-layer files (cli.js, ci.js, web.js) — spawn CLIs directly per four-tier architecture
 *   6. Test files — may use execFileSync/spawnSync for test harness
 *   7. Build scripts, config files, dist/ output
